Chrisâ€™s Ruby Sample App for OpenShift
=====================================

This is a demo application created using [these directions](https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex/blob/master/README.md#installation).  

To test locally, use rackup, then push to github.  Assuming that the webhook was correctly created within github, your changes should push to OpenShift immediately.
